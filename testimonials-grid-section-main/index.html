            "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code.
            I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming
            step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs
            who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
            They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular,
            was outstanding.
            It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
            In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience.
            It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
            recommend!"
